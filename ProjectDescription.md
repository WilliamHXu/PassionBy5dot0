Ideas for a passion project


# Idea 1:
# Realmkeepers

Realmkeepers is a collectable card game set in a fantasy universe created by William Xu. It is a 1v1 card game incorporating 
the classic CCG elements of games like Magic and Hearthstone with a twist of Dominion/Ascension thrown in. It's fun to play 
with friends but because of the dynamic win conditions that may come up throughout the game, it rewards competitive players 
who are flexible and quick on their toes instead of players who conform to a classic rock-paper-scissors mindset.

Demoable Version will feature the Unity engine for cross-platform play. 

The primitive game simply allows two users to build a deck of 20 cards based on the cards available in the players' 
collections and battle it out on a board. The project goal in the first demoable version will only have the Alliance faction 
playable to the user as well as one Realm deck to battle over: Pania. The two primary win conditions, Portal Destruction and 
Favor of the Gods, will both be in play.

Additional Features include a Player Profile with win/loss tracking, the results of the last 10 games played, as well as a 
Avatar picture of their choice, and a deck-builder interface in which all of the cards of the Basic Alliance set will be 
unlocked.

# Idea 2:
# MyLeague

MyLeague is an social networking app that helps league coordinators or even just you and your tennis/basketball/esports/sports playing friends manage a league of your very own. If you are competitive enough with your pals to try to put a league or a tournament bracket together, then you should be engaged enough to realize that there isn't an app that allows to to put everything in one place that you want. I've organized a tennis league before using a mix of emailing people, a separate scheduling app, another separate Google Sheets to keep track of game results, and YET ANOTHER SEPARATE league page to advertise to people that we even have this league in the first place.

That's a lot of time spent planning logistics and making sure everything is consistent everywhere and not a lot of time 
actually playing your favorite sport. MyLeague takes all of that and puts it in one place. Individual users can create their 
own leagues and invite their friends to it using the in-app invite feature or a url. Then, you can put all of your League's 
information in one place: Your League Tab. Here, you can advertise your League and what it's about to other people out there 
if you want to expand, or you can keep your league private and off the main search and just invite your close friends from 
there.
